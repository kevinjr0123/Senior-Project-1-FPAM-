Fairer Prescription Adherence Model

Problem Statement: Black Americans have historically been the victims of racial bias in the US. This racial bias is prevalent in many institutions, including healthcare. Research has shown that healthcare providers have beliefs that Black Americans do not experience the same amount of pain as white Americans. This may lead to discrepancies in how pain medication is administered to both races.

Product Description: We are creating a Machine learning model that’ll be able to take in the data of those in need of medication more fairly in order to create a more equal medical environment where patients receive the care they need, regardless of race.  For this model, we’ll need data sets that’re more inclusive towards the experience of colored people; we’ll also look into ways to match patients with proper medication in a way that won’t increase the chances of that patient relapsing due to possible addictions their family line suffers from.  This product will be a provider service.

Limitations:
Machine Learning experience
